Steam Parser v.1.1.

I was working on this project in the fall of 2022. It might have issues now, but then everything was ok.
It works on Lolzteam API. Currency is ruble.

Instructions.
1. Enter ids in file 'temp'
2. Enter your token in the "ENTER_YOUR_TOKEN" field.
You can create your own token for money here: https://zelenka.guru/account/api
3. Run steam_inv_parsing.py

Possible issues:
If inventory is not included in the checksum, it means that:
1) it might be private account
2) you entered incorrect lolzteam token

Good luck.
